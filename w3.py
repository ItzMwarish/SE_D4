# Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) 
# that calculates the final price after applying a discount. 
# The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters.
#  If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
# Using the calculate_discount function,
#  prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. 
# Print the final price after applying the discount, 
# or if no discount was applied, 
# print the original price.
