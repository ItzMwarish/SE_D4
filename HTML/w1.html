    <h1>A Million Chapatis for Nairobi</h1>
    <p>
      President William Ruto has pledged to enhance Nairobi's 'Dishi na County'
      school feeding program by providing a chapati-making machine capable of
      producing up to one million chapatis daily. <br />This initiative aims to
      support Governor Johnson Sakaja's efforts to include chapatis in the meals
      provided to over 300,000 children in public schools across Nairobi. The
      'Dishi na County' program, launched on June 20, 2023, seeks to improve
      student health, academic performance, and school attendance by addressing
      classroom hunger. It features centralized kitchens in each of Nairobi's 17
      sub-counties, preparing and distributing hot, balanced meals daily.
      Parents contribute a subsidized fee of Ksh5 per meal, payable through a
      smart wristband system known as Tap2Eat. Additionally, the national
      government plans to expand the school feeding program to benefit four
      million children across the country, up from the current 1.6 million, with
      a budget allocation of Ksh5 billion. These efforts underscore a commitment
      to ensuring that no child in Kenya attends school hungry, thereby
      promoting better educational outcomes and overall well-being.
